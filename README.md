Senior System Design Engineer at Western Digital working on Performance System Architecture for Enterprise SSDs. I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2020, with a Bachelor of Science in Computer and Systems Engineering. Relocated to the Bay Area in 2021. Huge Dodgers and baseball fan. Recently I've become passionate about cooking. I have always labeled myself as a foodie but I've learned to love trying new recipes.
